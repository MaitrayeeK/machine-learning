# Linear Regression Project: Mobile App vs. Website Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes a dataset containing information about customers who buy clothes online from a store that offers in-store style and clothing advice sessions. Customers interact with personal stylists during these sessions and then can make purchases either through a mobile app or a website. The company aims to determine whether to prioritize improving the mobile app experience or the website for enhancing customer engagement and sales.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of the following features:
- Avg. Session Length: Average time spent in style/clothing advice sessions.
- Time on App: Time spent on the mobile app.
- Time on Website: Time spent on the website.
- Length of Membership: Number of years the customer has been a member.

## Objective
The primary objective is to perform a linear regression analysis to understand the relationship between time spent on the mobile app/website and customer engagement. By analyzing this relationship, the company can make data-driven decisions regarding which platform to focus on for improvement.

## Files Included
- `Ecommerce.csv`: The dataset containing customer information.
- `ecommerce_linear_regression.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, EDA, model building, and evaluation.
